# Tip Calculator

This is a simple Python program that calculates how much to leave as a tip after a meal.

## How it works

- Asks the user for the cost of the meal (e.g., `$50.00`)
- Asks what percentage to tip (e.g., `15%`)
- Calculates and displays the exact amount to leave

## Example

How much was the meal? $100.00
What percentage would you like to tip? 15%
Leave $15.00
